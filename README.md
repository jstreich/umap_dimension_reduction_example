# umap_dimension_reduction_example
This is a UMAP example script [Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection] to reduce high dimensionality to lower dimensional space.


UMAP is a machine learning based dimension reduction algorithm that projects
high dimensional data onto low dimensional space [manifold projection] while
optimizing the higher dimensional representation. UMAP is great for reducing
covariate space in a predictive model to fewer vectors that represent 
several descriptive dimensions.
